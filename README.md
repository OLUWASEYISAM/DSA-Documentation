### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning, and preparations, we performed the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as
1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. Which product are top sellers?
3. What are the product on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis 

``` SQL
SELECT * FROM Employee
INSERT INTO Employee
```
