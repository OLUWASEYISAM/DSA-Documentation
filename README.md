### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning, and preparations, we performed the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection: Checking for Missing data using COUNTBLANK functions and Filters, It was discovered that Product base Margin column has 63 empty cells/Missing data.
2. Handling missing variables: Missing data under the Product base Margin were handled using backward fill.
3. Data cleaning and formatting: We then do the needed formatting for Numbers, Dates and texts so as to prepare Data for Analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as

#### Case Scenario 1
1. Which product category had the highest sales? 
  
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales? 
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
6. 


### Data Analysis
